This is the code for the Takin MnSi plugin module and its helper tools.
It calculates the dispersion and the dynamical structure factor for the
helimagnetic, the field-polarised, and the skyrmion phase of MnSi.

The ext/ directory contains the source code of the external libraries on
which this code depends.

This code has been used in the following papers:
	- https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.100.060404

This code is based on theoretical magnon dispersion models and their
Mathematica implementations by M. Garst and J. Waizner, see our papers
above and these references:

Furthermore, this code is based on Python implementations by M. Kugler
and G. Brandl of early versions of the mentioned theoretical models.
